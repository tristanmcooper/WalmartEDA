Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Walmart Data Science Project. This project is a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's sales trends over three years, focusing particularly on the impact of temperature and seasonal variations.

## Project Overview

Our team has embarked on an exploratory study to understand how cyclic factors like temperature and holidays influence sales volumes at Walmart stores. This analysis aims to provide insights that could assist in strategic planning and operational adjustments.

## Abstract

In this data-driven investigation, we delve into Walmart's sales data to discern patterns linked to temperature fluctuations and holiday seasons. Preliminary findings suggest a significant correlation between sales volumes and both abnormal temperatures and major holidays. The study particularly highlights the intensified consumer purchasing behavior during the December holiday season, irrespective of temperature changes.

## Research Question

How do weather conditions and seasonal holidays affect consumer purchasing behavior at Walmart? Are these effects more pronounced during periods with abnormal temperature deviations?

## Background and Prior Work

References and studies have demonstrated that weather conditions significantly influence retail sales, affecting both the frequency of purchases and the types of products purchased. Our analysis builds upon findings from seminal studies that show how temperature and other weather-related factors such as precipitation and UV intensity impact sales.

## Data

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Dataset Name:** Walmart Dataset (from Kaggle)
- **Dataset Link:** [Walmart Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset)
- **Observations:** 6435
- **Variables:** 8

The dataset includes weekly sales data across 45 Walmart stores for nearly three years, capturing essential metrics like weekly sales, temperature, and holiday flags.

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that both extreme temperatures and holiday periods significantly impact sales, with optimal sales occurring during moderate weather conditions and recognized shopping holidays.
